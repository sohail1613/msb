With its powerful vacuum motor, the device is able to transport heavy products such as corn, beans, chickpeas as well as grains such as wheat, barley, paddy, rye, and oat pneumatically (with vacuum) in 9 to 12 seconds in the laboratory or sample room. collects the sample in the collection container. With the sample collection container with a transparent window on it, the sample amount can be followed, and the sampling amount can be adjusted if desired. Since the sample container is not in the cyclone structure, it does not have a filter. Therefore, it does not require frequent filter changes. The amount of oscillation of its strong and heavy body has been greatly reduced thanks to 4 flagpoles. The sampling arm (boom) of the device consists of two parts as inner and outer boom, it can be extended up to 3 booms if desired. By hydraulically removing the inner boom from the outer boom, the sampling distance is greatly extended. Thus, the device can scan an area of \\u200B\\u200B11 meters in total, 5.5 meters on the right and left. Thus, the necessity of mounting the device at a very close distance to vehicles is eliminated. In addition, even in long trucks and tow trucks, samples can be taken easily without moving the vehicle. Probe length 2.5 m. The sampling probe can move 120 degrees to the right and 120 degrees to the left, for a total of 240 degrees. Thanks to the joystick, it can be controlled both from the control room and near the vehicle. The device can easily perform all movements with its joystick. Since the device makes all of the right, left, up, down, forward and backward movements not with electric motors, but with a much stronger, fast, quiet and long-lasting hydraulic system, it is easy to use. The external dimensions of the device are 75x75x400 cm. The net weight of the device is 530 kg.

With its powerful vacuum\n                motor, the device is able to transport heavy products such as\n                corn, beans, chickpeas as well as grains such as wheat, barley,\n                paddy, rye, and oat pneumatically (with vacuum) in 9 to 12\n                seconds in the laboratory or sample room. collects the sample in\n                the collection container. With the sample collection container\n                with a transparent window on it, the sample amount can be\n                followed, and the sampling amount can be adjusted if desired.\n                Since the sample container is not in the cyclone structure, it\n                does not have a filter. Therefore, it does not require frequent\n                filter changes. The amount of oscillation of its strong and\n                heavy body has been greatly reduced thanks to 4 flagpoles. The\n                sampling arm (boom) of the device consists of two parts as inner\n                and outer boom, it can be extended up to 3 booms if desired. By\n                hydraulically removing the inner boom from the outer boom, the\n                sampling distance is greatly extended. Thus, the device can scan\n                an area of ​​11 meters in total, 5.5 meters on the right and\n                left. Thus, the necessity of mounting the device at a very close\n                distance to vehicles is eliminated. In addition, even in long\n                trucks and tow trucks, samples can be taken easily without\n                moving the vehicle. Probe length 2.5 m. The sampling probe can\n                move 120 degrees to the right and 120 degrees to the left, for a\n                total of 240 degrees. Thanks to the joystick, it can be\n                controlled both from the control room and near the vehicle. The\n                device can easily perform all movements with its joystick. Since\n                the device makes all of the right, left, up, down, forward and\n                backward movements not with electric motors, but with a much\n                stronger, fast, quiet and long-lasting hydraulic system, it is\n                easy to use. The external dimensions of the device are 75x75x400\n                cm. The net weight of the device is 530 kg. There is a 2-year\n                warranty and a 10-year spare part supply warranty, excluding\n                usage errors.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section className=\"about\" id=\"about\">\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\n              <img\n                src={WeightMachine}\n                alt=\"about\"\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\n                width=\"100%\"\n              />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\n              <h3>Hassas Terazi </h3>\n              <p>\n                It has a sensitivity of 0.01.
