Since the sample container is not in the cyclone structure, it does not have a filter. Therefore, it does not require frequent filter changes. The amount of oscillation of its strong and heavy body has been greatly reduced thanks to 4 flagpoles. The sampling arm (boom) of the device consists of two parts as inner and outer boom, it can be extended up to 3 booms if desired. By hydraulically removing the inner boom from the outer boom, the sampling distance is greatly extended. Thus, the device can scan an area of \\u200B\\u200B11 meters in total, 5.5 meters on the right and left. Thus, the necessity of mounting the device at a very close distance to vehicles is eliminated. In addition, even in long trucks and tow trucks, samples can be taken easily without moving the vehicle. Probe length 2.5 m. The sampling probe can move 120 degrees to the right and 120 degrees to the left, for a total of 240 degrees. Thanks to the joystick, it can be controlled both from the control room and near the vehicle. The device can easily perform all movements with its joystick. Since the device makes all of the right, left, up, down, forward and backward movements not with electric motors, but with a much stronger, fast, quiet and long-lasting hydraulic system, it is easy to use.
