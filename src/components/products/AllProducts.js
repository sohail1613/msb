              <h3>MSB GAB-306 Numune Alma Sondası </h3>
              <p>
                It is GAB-306 MODEL OF MSB BRAND. With its powerful vacuum
                motor, the device is able to transport heavy products such as
                corn, beans, chickpeas as well as grains such as wheat, barley,
                paddy, rye, and oat pneumatically (with vacuum) in 9 to 12
                seconds in the laboratory or sample room. collects the sample in
                the collection container. With the sample collection container
                with a transparent window on it, the sample amount can be
                followed, and the sampling amount can be adjusted if desired.
                Since the sample container is not in the cyclone structure, it
                does not have a filter. Therefore, it does not require frequent
                filter changes. The amount of oscillation of its strong and
                heavy body has been greatly reduced thanks to 4 flagpoles. The
                sampling arm (boom) of the device consists of two parts as inner
                and outer boom, it can be extended up to 3 booms if desired. By
                hydraulically removing the inner boom from the outer boom, the
                sampling distance is greatly extended. Thus, the device can scan
                an area of ​​11 meters in total, 5.5 meters on the right and
                left. Thus, the necessity of mounting the device at a very close
                distance to vehicles is eliminated. In addition, even in long
                trucks and tow trucks, samples can be taken easily without
                moving the vehicle. Probe length 2.5 m. The sampling probe can
                move 120 degrees to the right and 120 degrees to the left, for a
                total of 240 degrees. Thanks to the joystick, it can be
                controlled both from the control room and near the vehicle. The
                device can easily perform all movements with its joystick. Since
                the device makes all of the right, left, up, down, forward and
                backward movements not with electric motors, but with a much
                stronger, fast, quiet and long-lasting hydraulic system, it is
                easy to use. The external dimensions of the device are 75x75x400
                cm. The net weight of the device is 530 kg. There is a 2-year
                warranty and a 10-year spare part supply warranty, excluding
                usage errors.
